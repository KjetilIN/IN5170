# Exam 2022

## Exercise 1

We consider a program state in which the two program variables x and y both
have the value 5. Consider the following program:

```text
< x := x + y > || < y := y + x>
```

### 1a) Is your program interference-free? Explain your answer (1p.)

For a program to be interference free when the two processes does not write to the two variables. 
In this case it does. This means that the result will be different depending on the order of the parallel processes. 


### 1b) Do the processes satisfy the at-most-once property? Explain your answer (1p.)

We can consider the AMO-property for assignment by defining writes and reads for each variable:
```text
V_{S1} = {x, y}
W_{S1} = {x}

V_{S2} = {x, y}
W_{S2} = {y}


V_{S1} U W_{S2} = {y}
V_{S2} U W_{S1} = {x}
```

We can see that reading and writing interfere with each other. This means the AMO property does not hold. 
We can also see this in 1c), which shows that the different order of execution leads to different results. 


### 1c) What are possible pre- and post-conditions for the program? (2p.)

The task states that both variables start with 5 then the only pre condition is: 

```text
{x:= 5, y:=5}
```

However, the end condition based on the order of the program could be:

```text
S1 -> S2 => {x:= 10, y:= 15}
S2 -> S1 => {x:= 15, y:= 10}
```

As we can see, there is two orders different orders that is possible, which leads to two different orders of the program.

### 1d) Prove your post-condition using program logic for all states that satisfy the pre-condition (3p.)

We can write the post condition logic with the following notation:

```math
(x:= 10 \wedge y:= 15) \lor (x:= 15 \land y:= 10) 
```


## Exercise 2 

TODO: after session types lecture 

## Exercise 3

Explain the difference between weak and strong fairness: 


Weak fairness ensures that if a process is enabled and remains enabled, it must eventually execute.
Strong fairness ensures that if a process is enabled infinitely often, it must eventually execute.


## Exercise 4 - Semaphores 

We consider a barbershop with one barber and a waiting room with n chairs for waiting customers
(n may be 0). The following rules apply:
- If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep
- A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep
- If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are
occupied and sits in an empty chair if it’s available
- When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any
waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none


### 4 a)
Complete the code below to provide a solution based on semaphores
that ensures the following requirements:
- the barber never sleeps while there are waiting customers and
- there is never more than n customers waiting in the waiting room.

Briefly explain why your solution satisfies these requirements:
- A costumer that is sitting in the waiting room, will automatically wake the barber, if the barber is sleeping. 
- The costumer will not enter the waiting room, if there are no seats available. The costumer will leave if there are no seats available. An alternative if we would want to allow the costumer to "wait outside the waiting room" - i.e busy wait until there is a seat available. But instead we make the costumer leave the shop and try again.  


```text
int freeSeats = n;

// Mutex for grabbing a seat
sem waitingRoom := 1; 

// Signal to wake up barber
sem barberSleep := 0;

// Signal when a customer in the waiting room can get a haircut. 
sem costumers := 1;

// Signal when costumer can leave the shop
sem chair := 0; 


process Customer{
    while(true){
        // Enter waiting room if there is space for costumer
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
        }else{
            // No free seats, leave the waiting room and try again later by leaving 
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Ready for haircut, wake up barber
        V(barberSleep); 

        // Wait for haircut 
        P(costumer); 

        // Leave the waiting room 
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1; 
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait until allowed to leave the shop (haircut is then done)
        P(chair);
    }
}

process Barber{
    while(true){
        // Inspect the waiting room seats, and see if there are any waiting costumers 
        P(waitingRoom);
        if(freeSeats < n){
            // Leave the waiting room 
            V(waitingRoom);

            // Allow costumer to enter
            V(costumer);

            // HAIR CUT LOGIC

            // Make costumer leave
            V(chair);
        }else{
            // Leave the waiting room 
            V(waitingRoom);

            // Sleep
            P(barberSleep);
        }

    }
}
```

### 4 b) Fair solution?

The solution is not fair for the costumer. When all are waiting in the waiting room, there is a possibility that a costumer   


### 4 c) Barber with express lane 

The barber shop introduces an “express” category of customers, who should have priority over regular customers. Implement a solution such that priority customers can bypass regular customers, using the same semaphores. Provide a solution to the Barbershop with priorities by completing the code below. Briefly explain how your solution gives priority to express customers.

This solution works by: 
- Always giving priority to express costumers, if there are any in the waiting room. 


```text
int seatsInBarbershop := n; 
int freeSeats := seatsInBarberShop;

// Keep track of delayed costumers 
int delayed_customer := 0; 
int delayed_express_customer := 0;

// Sit in waiting
sem waitingRoom := 1; 

// Signal when a regular costumer can enter the barber shop 
sem regular_costumer := 0; 

// Signal when a express costumer can enter the barber shop 
sem express_costumer := 0;

// Signaled when barber is done with haircut
sem chair := 0; 

// Wake up barber semaphore
sem barberSleep := 0; 

process RegularCustomer {
    while (true) {
        // Enter shop and take a seat
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
            delayed_customer += 1;
            V(waitingRoom);
        }else{
            // No seats available, leave
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }

        // Wake barber if sleeping 
        V(barberSleep);

        // Wait on being allowed to get the haircut 
        P(regular_costumer);

        // Left the waiting room, getting haircut 
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1;
        delayed_customer -= 1;
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait for barber to be done with haircut and leave
        P(chair);
    }
}

process PriorityCustomer {
    while (true) {
        // Enter shop and take a seat
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
            delayed_express_customer += 1;
            V(waitingRoom);
        }else{
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }

        // Wake barber if sleeping 
        V(barberSleep);

        // Wait on being allowed to get the haircut 
        P(express_costumer);

        // Left the waiting room
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1;
        delayed_express_customer -= 1;
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait for barber to be done with haircut and leave
        P(chair);

    }
}

process Barber {
    while (true) {
        // Enter the waiting room and check how many costumers there are
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats = seatsInBarberShop){
            // No costumers, go to sleep
            V(waitingRoom);
            P(barberSleep);
            
            // Waken up, and will go back to doing work 
            continue;
        }else{
            // If there are a priority costumer we let them in
            if(delayed_express_costumer > 0){
                V(express_costumer);
                V(waitingRoom);
            }else{
                // No priority costumer, take regular costumer
                V(regular_costumer);
                V(waitingRoom);
            }
        }

        // HAIR CUT LOGIC

        // Let costumer leave the chair, done with hair cut
        V(chair);
    }
}
```

## Exercise 5 - Monitor 

We consider monitors with the following operations:
```text
cond cv;
wait(cv);
signal(cv);
signal_all(cv);
```

### 5 a) Barber shop with monitor 

### 5 b) Monitor invariant  


## Exercise 6 - Async message sending  

We consider a producer consumer problem in which multiple producers send data to a consumer
via a buffer channel. Let Producer1 send value 1 on the buffer channel, Producer2 send value 2
on the buffer, etc

### 6 a) Producer consumer
