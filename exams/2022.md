# Exam 2022

## Exercise 1

We consider a program state in which the two program variables x and y both
have the value 5. Consider the following program:

```text
< x := x + y > || < y := y + x>
```

### 1a) Is your program interference-free? Explain your answer (1p.)

For a program to be interference free when the two processes does not write to the two variables. 
In this case it does. This means that the result will be different depending on the order of the parallel processes. 


### 1b) Do the processes satisfy the at-most-once property? Explain your answer (1p.)

We can consider the AMO-property for assignment by defining writes and reads for each variable:
```text
V_{S1} = {x, y}
W_{S1} = {x}

V_{S2} = {x, y}
W_{S2} = {y}


V_{S1} U W_{S2} = {y}
V_{S2} U W_{S1} = {x}
```

We can see that reading and writing interfere with each other. This means the AMO property does not hold. 
We can also see this in 1c), which shows that the different order of execution leads to different results. 


### 1c) What are possible pre- and post-conditions for the program? (2p.)

The task states that both variables start with 5 then the only pre condition is: 

```text
{x:= 5, y:=5}
```

However, the end condition based on the order of the program could be:

```text
S1 -> S2 => {x:= 10, y:= 15}
S2 -> S1 => {x:= 15, y:= 10}
```

As we can see, there is two orders different orders that is possible, which leads to two different orders of the program.

### 1d) Prove your post-condition using program logic for all states that satisfy the pre-condition (3p.)

We can write the post condition logic with the following notation:

```math
(x:= 10 \wedge y:= 15) \lor (x:= 15 \land y:= 10) 
```


## Exercise 2 

TODO: after session types lecture 

## Exercise 3

Explain the difference between weak and strong fairness: 


Weak fairness ensures that if a process is enabled and remains enabled, it must eventually execute.
Strong fairness ensures that if a process is enabled infinitely often, it must eventually execute.


## Exercise 4 - Semaphores 

We consider a barbershop with one barber and a waiting room with n chairs for waiting customers
(n may be 0). The following rules apply:
- If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep
- A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep
- If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all chairs are
occupied and sits in an empty chair if it’s available
- When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if there are any
waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none


### 4 a)
Complete the code below to provide a solution based on semaphores
that ensures the following requirements:
- the barber never sleeps while there are waiting customers and
- there is never more than n customers waiting in the waiting room.

Briefly explain why your solution satisfies these requirements:
- A customer that is sitting in the waiting room, will automatically wake the barber, if the barber is sleeping. 
- The customer will not enter the waiting room, if there are no seats available. The customer will leave if there are no seats available. An alternative if we would want to allow the customer to "wait outside the waiting room" - i.e busy wait until there is a seat available. But instead we make the customer leave the shop and try again.  


```text
int freeSeats = n;

// Mutex for grabbing a seat
sem waitingRoom := 1; 

// Signal to wake up barber
sem barberSleep := 0;

// Signal when a customer in the waiting room can get a haircut. 
sem customers := 1;

// Signal when customer can leave the shop
sem chair := 0; 


process Customer{
    while(true){
        // Enter waiting room if there is space for customer
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
        }else{
            // No free seats, leave the waiting room and try again later by leaving 
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Ready for haircut, wake up barber
        V(barberSleep); 

        // Wait for haircut 
        P(customer); 

        // Leave the waiting room 
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1; 
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait until allowed to leave the shop (haircut is then done)
        P(chair);
    }
}

process Barber{
    while(true){
        // Inspect the waiting room seats, and see if there are any waiting customers 
        P(waitingRoom);
        if(freeSeats < n){
            // Leave the waiting room 
            V(waitingRoom);

            // Allow customer to enter
            V(customer);

            // HAIR CUT LOGIC

            // Make customer leave
            V(chair);
        }else{
            // Leave the waiting room 
            V(waitingRoom);

            // Sleep
            P(barberSleep);
        }

    }
}
```

### 4 b) Fair solution?

The solution is not fair for the customer. When all are waiting in the waiting room, there is a possibility that a customer   


### 4 c) Barber with express lane 

The barber shop introduces an “express” category of customers, who should have priority over regular customers. Implement a solution such that priority customers can bypass regular customers, using the same semaphores. Provide a solution to the Barbershop with priorities by completing the code below. Briefly explain how your solution gives priority to express customers.

This solution works by: 
- Always giving priority to express customers, if there are any in the waiting room. 


```text
int seatsInBarbershop := n; 
int freeSeats := seatsInBarberShop;

// Keep track of delayed customers 
int delayed_customer := 0; 
int delayed_express_customer := 0;

// Sit in waiting
sem waitingRoom := 1; 

// Signal when a regular customer can enter the barber shop 
sem regular_customer := 0; 

// Signal when a express customer can enter the barber shop 
sem express_customer := 0;

// Signaled when barber is done with haircut
sem chair := 0; 

// Wake up barber semaphore
sem barberSleep := 0; 

process RegularCustomer {
    while (true) {
        // Enter shop and take a seat
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
            delayed_customer += 1;
            V(waitingRoom);
        }else{
            // No seats available, leave
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }

        // Wake barber if sleeping 
        V(barberSleep);

        // Wait on being allowed to get the haircut 
        P(regular_customer);

        // Left the waiting room, getting haircut 
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1;
        delayed_customer -= 1;
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait for barber to be done with haircut and leave
        P(chair);
    }
}

process PriorityCustomer {
    while (true) {
        // Enter shop and take a seat
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats > 0){
            freeSeats -= 1;
            delayed_express_customer += 1;
            V(waitingRoom);
        }else{
            V(waitingRoom);
            continue;
        }

        // Wake barber if sleeping 
        V(barberSleep);

        // Wait on being allowed to get the haircut 
        P(express_customer);

        // Left the waiting room
        P(waitingRoom);
        freeSeats += 1;
        delayed_express_customer -= 1;
        V(waitingRoom);

        // Wait for barber to be done with haircut and leave
        P(chair);

    }
}

process Barber {
    while (true) {
        // Enter the waiting room and check how many customers there are
        P(waitingRoom);
        if (freeSeats = seatsInBarberShop){
            // No customers, go to sleep
            V(waitingRoom);
            P(barberSleep);
            
            // Waken up, and will go back to doing work 
            continue;
        }else{
            // If there are a priority customer we let them in
            if(delayed_express_customer > 0){
                V(express_customer);
                V(waitingRoom);
            }else{
                // No priority customer, take regular customer
                V(regular_customer);
                V(waitingRoom);
            }
        }

        // HAIR CUT LOGIC

        // Let customer leave the chair, done with hair cut
        V(chair);
    }
}
```

### 4 d) Evaluation of 4c

Given the solution on the barber shop with express lane. Evaluate 

1. mutual exclusion? (2p.)

The solution provides mutual exclusion where it is needed. 
With semaphores, we can create a mutex by initializing the semaphore with the value of 1. This allows only one resource to pass the P(). 

We need mutual exclusion for the seats in the waiting area. We ensure this by using a mutex semaphore around the changing and checking the free seating variable. 

We also need to mutually exclude multiple customers to enter the barber to get haircut at the time. This we do by having the semaphore for getting an haircut initialized to 0. All customers in the waiting room will busy wait here. Then the barber will do a V(), which will allow a single customer to enter the barber shop. 

To conclude, the solution does have mutual exclusion. 


2. absence of deadlock? (2p.)

There is deadlock. We ensure that all customers wake up the barber, meaning, that the barber cannot sleep when there are customers. This will lead to customers being processed. 

First, all P() and V() operations are paired in a way that ensures that we don't release a permit. The mutexes are released after the check. And the chair is released after a haircut. 

Secondly, the order of events is consistent. 

Third, processes does not hold and wait on permits that will never be given. 

There are also clear recovery mechanisms. Such as when there is no seats in the waiting room, or if there is a sleeping barber. 


3. absence of unnecessary delay? (2p.)

There is no unnecessary delay. We ensure to release our seat in the waiting room as the customer comes in the barber shop and gets a haircut. This allows for new customers to enter the waiting room. 

4. fairness? If the solution is not fair, explain how you could make it fair. (4p.)

The solution is not fair when it comes to giving each customer the ability to enter the barber room and get a haircut. 
When all customers are waiting to be allowed in the room, only one is allowed at the time, and this is the first customer to grab the permit of the mutex in the busy wait. For example, in the regular customer queue, a customer can be stuck there and never get a haircut, because there is no guarantee that a customer will get its turn. Semaphores does not have a queue, all will just busy wait. 

It is also not fair for regular customers. The task specifies the priority customers have priority. Meaning, if there is a priority customer in the waiting room, all other customers have to wait. There is no guarantee that a regular customer gets a haircut, as long as there is at least one priority customer in the waiting room. 

To make it fair, we could do different solutions. A solution would be to make the barber count how many priority customer it has taken in, and then use this to allow a regular customer to enter the barbershop. For example, every 5th customer can be a regular customer. This will improve the fairness, and still give priority to non-regular customers. 

Another implementation could be to use FIFO queues, to enure that the order of customers arriving to the store would be the order of which customer to be taken. We would have two queues: one for regular costumer and one for express costumers. This will be fair and ensure that all costumers that enter the waiting room will eventually get a hair cut.

## Exercise 5 - Monitor 

We consider monitors with the following operations:
```text
cond cv;
wait(cv);
signal(cv);
signal_all(cv);
```

### 5 a) Barber shop with monitor 

Use the monitor operations listed above to make a monitor solution to the priority customer barber shop of Exercise 4. Provide your solution by completing the code below and explain briefly how your solution gives priority to express customers.


The solution uses Signal and continue (SC): 

```text
monitor BarberShop{
    int seatsInBarbershop = n;
    int nr = 0; // number of regular customers
    int np = 0; // number of priority customers 
    bool barberSleeping := false; // Condition for when barber is sleeping

    // Waiting room 
    cond waitingRoom: 

    // Queues of regular and priority customers in the waiting room
    cond regularWaitingCustomer;
    cond priorityWaitingCustomer;

    // Signaled when barber is waken up
    cond barber;

    // Signal when customer is ready
    cond customerReady;

    // Signal when customer can leave
    cond chair; 


    procedure barber(){
        while(true){
            // Barber goes to sleep if there ar no costumers in the waiting room
            while(seatsInBarbershop = n){
                barberSleeping := true; 
                wait(barber);
            }

            // Choose a haircut based on who is next in line 
            // Give priority to 
            if(np > 0){
                // Signal a priority costumer
                signal(priorityWaitingCustomer);
            }else{
                // Signal a regular costumer 
                signal(regularWaitingCustomer);
            }

            // Wait for customer to be ready before doing the haircut
            wait(customerReady);

            // HAIRCUT LOGIC


            // Signal the costumer to leave the chair
            signal(chair);

        }
    }

    procedure regularCustomer(){
        while(true){
            while(seatsInBarbershop <= 0){
                wait(waitingRoom);
            }

            // Take a seat in barbershop waiting room 
            seatsInBarbershop--;
            nr++;

            // Wake up barber and stand in queue
            // Only one customer wakes up the barber
            if(barberSleeping){
                barberSleeping := false;
                signal(barber);
            }
            
            wait(regularWaitingCustomer);

            // Customer left the waiting room, and got in the barber chair 
            seatsInBarbershop++;
            signal(waitingRoom);
            
            // Customer is in chair ready for a haircut
            signal(customerReady):

            // GETTING A HAIRCUT LOGIC

            // Wait on being done with the haircut
            wait(chair);

            // Leave the shop 
            nr--;
        }
    }

    procedure priorityCustomer(){
        while(true){
            while(seatsInBarbershop <= 0){
                wait(waitingRoom);
            }

            // Take a seat in barbershop waiting room 
            seatsInBarbershop--;
            np++;

            // Wake up barber and stand in queue
            // Only one customer wakes up the barber
            if(barberSleeping){
                barberSleeping := false;
                signal(barber);
            }
            
            wait(priorityWaitingCustomer);

            // Customer left the waiting room, and got in the barber chair 
            seatsInBarbershop++;
            signal(waitingRoom);

            // Customer is in chair ready for a haircut
            signal(customerReady):

            // GETTING A HAIRCUT LOGIC

            // Wait on being done with the haircut
            wait(chair);

            // Leave the shop 
            np--;
        }
    }
}
```


### 5 b) Monitor invariant  

What could be a monitor invariant for the Barbershop monitor? Explain briefly why the monitor invariant holds for your monitor solution.

The monitor invariant for this barbershop is:
```text
0 <= seatsInBarbershop <= n AND
nr >= 0 AND 
np >= 0 AND
nr + np == n - seatsInBarbershop
```

This invariant holds because:
1. seatsInBarbershop can never be negative (checked by while loop) or exceed n (initial value)
2. nr and np are only decremented after being incremented, so they stay non-negative 
3. When a customer enters waiting room:
  - seatsInBarbershop decreases by 1
  - Either nr or np increases by 1
  - So nr + np = n - seatsInBarbershop remains true
4. When a customer moves to barber chair:
  - seatsInBarbershop increases by 1
  - Customer hasn't left yet (nr/np not decremented)
  - Another customer can now enter waiting room
5. When customer leaves after haircut:
  - Either nr or np decreases by 1
  - That customer had already freed their waiting room seat
  - So nr + np = n - seatsInBarbershop still holds

The monitor procedures ensure these relationships are maintained through proper synchronization with the condition variables waitingRoom, regularWaitingCustomer, priorityWaitingCustomer, barber, customerReady and chair.


## Exercise 6 - Async message sending  

We consider a producer consumer problem in which multiple producers send data to a consumer
via a buffer channel. Let Producer1 send value 1 on the buffer channel, Producer2 send value 2
on the buffer, etc

### 6 a) Producer consumer
