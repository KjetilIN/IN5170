# Group Session 1

## Ex1. Parallelism and concurrency

Parallelism implies that execution run at the same time. 

Concurrent processes appear to be executed at the same time, but in reality is just an illusion provided by the OS. The two processes start at the same time and run and complete in overlapping time periods, but not necessary at the same time. 

Given that we have a mono-processor, can we use concurrency to speed up the program? 

**Yes!** Concurrency could even then speed up the process of executing programs. For example while another process is waiting (for I/O or requests), we can then execute another step in another task. 

Imagine having to download from multiple URL's. **Without concurrency, the CPU has to wait for the data to be downloaded for each URL before moving on.** By downloading all the data concurrently, the CPU will be better used and will overall complete the task faster. 


## Ex2. Pattern Finder

Given the following await code: 

```
string buffer;
bool done := false;

process Finder { 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        wait for buffer to be full or done to be true ;
        if ( done ) break ;
        line1 := buffer ;
        signal that buffer is empty ;
        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader { # r e a d new l i n e s
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line ;
        if (EOF) { done := true ; break ; }
        wait for buffer to be empty ;
        buffer := line2 ;
        signal that buffer is full ;
    }
}

```

### Part A: Add sync code for synchronizing access to buffer: 

Adding a lock to the critical sections. 
The suggested solution is to use a lock.
With await syntax, the solution is: 


Improvements after group session (almost correct solution):
-  await instead of while => async notation 


Learnings: 
-  buffer_full assignment does not need to be protected because the other processes are stop waiting. 
   -  We want the atomic blocks to be as small as possible, and here we simply avoid it. 

```
string buffer;
bool done := false;
bool buffer_full := false; 

process Finder { 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        //wait for buffer to be full or done to be true 
        if ( done ) break ;

        <await buffer_full == true>
        line1 := buffer; 
        buffer_full:= false;
        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader { 
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line ;
        if (EOF) { done := true ; break ; }

        // Appending data to the buffer again 
        <await buffer_full == false>
        buffer := line2;
        buffer_full := true; 
    }
}

```

### Part B: Extend the program to read two files 

To ensure that the algorithm is fair, we need to implement fairness into the processes. The best algorithm in this case, is the Ticket algorithm. 

- Two readers
- Need to notify that both reader processes are done reading (multiple ways to do this)
  - One file might be longer than another 
  - Best way is to have a counter of how many readers are still reading 
- Performance (reader might be slower)
- It is unfair only if one process cannot 
  - The task does not require 


```
string buffer;
int readers_working := 2;
bool buffer_full := false; 

process Finder { 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        //wait for buffer to be full or done to be true 
        if ( readers_working == 0 ) break ;

        <await buffer_full == true>
        line1 := buffer; 
        buffer_full:= false;
        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader[ i = 1 to 2] { 
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input of the file for the reader ;
        if (EOF) { <reader_working = reader_working - 1> ; break ; }

        // Appending data to the buffer again 
        <await buffer_full == false>
        buffer := line2;
        buffer_full := true; 
    }
}

```


## Ext. 3 Producer consumer 

Change it so that the variable p is local to the producer process
and c is local to the consumer process, not global. Hence, those variables cannot be used to
synchronize access to buf. 

The following code, copies the array from the producer to the consumer. 


Original await code: 

```
int buffer, p:= 0; c:= 0;


process Producer{
    int a[N];
    while (p<N){
        <await (p == c); >
        buffer := a[p];
        p:= p+1; 
    }
}

process Consumer{
    int b[N];
    while(c<N){
        <await (p > c);>
        b[c] := buffer; 
        c:= c+1; 
    }
}
```

We can now not use the local variables. 
How can we then sync access to buffer?

```
int buffer;
int index; 


process Producer{
    int a[N];
    int p = 0; 
    while (p<N){
        <await (index == 0); >
        buffer := a[p];
        p:= p+1; 
        index:= index+1; 
    }
}

process Consumer{
    int b[N];
    int c = 0; 
    while(c<N){
        <await (index == 1);>
        b[c] := buffer; 
        c:= c+1; 
        index := 1; 
    }
}
```

The solution is having a variable that is either 0 or 1. 
By doing it this way, we ensure that each of them is excluding each other. 


## Ext. 4 Executions and atomicity 

### Part 1: 

Suppose each assignment statement is implemented by a single machine instruction and hence is atomic. How many possible executions are there? What are the possible final values of x and y?

```
int x := 0, y := 0; 

co 
    x:= x+1; # S1
    x:= x+2; # S2
||
    x:= x+2; # S3
    y:= y-x; # S4
oc

```

6 possible executions : 
- S1, S2, S3, S4
- S1, S3, S2, S4
- S1, S3, S4, S2
- S3, S1, S2, S4
- S3, S1, S4, S2
- S3, S4, S1, S2

Final values: 
- S1, S2, S3, S4 => x:= 5, y:= -5
- S1, S3, S2, S4 => x:= 5, y:= -5  
- S1, S3, S4, S2 => x:= 5, y:= -3
- S3, S1, S2, S4 => x:= 5, y:= -5
- S3, S1, S4, S2 => x:= 5, y:= -3
- S3, S4, S1, S2 => x:= 5, y:= -2

Final state
{x:=5 & (y:= -5 || y:= -3 || y:= -2)} 

### Part 2: 

Suppose each assignment statement is implemented by three atomic actions that load a register, add or subtract a value from that register, then store the result. How many possible executions are there now? What are the possible final values of x and y?


There is a formula for this 

n: processes
m: atomic statements in each process 

n = 2,
m = 6, (two statements where each statement is three machine instructions)

**executions = (n * m)! / m!^n**
           = 12! / 6!^2
           = 924 


The values: 
- (x,y) E (3,-3), (4,-4), (5, -5), (2, -2), (3, -1), (5, -2), (4, -2), (3, -2)

It is very hard to: 
- Find all solutions
- Know that you have all solutions


## Ext. 5 Interleaving, non-determinism, and atomicity

Program: 

```
int x:=2, y:=3;

co
    < x:=x+y > #S1
||
    < y:=x*y > #S2
oc
```

### Part 1: Final values?


For the two processes with one atomic statement each:
- S1, S2 => x:= 5, y:= 15
- S2, S1 => x:= 8, y:= 6

{(x:=5, y:=15) || (x:=8, y:= 6)}

### Part 2: Final values? (with non-atomic operations)

Suppose the angle brackets are removed and each assignment statement is now implemented by three atomic actions: read the variables, add or multiply, and write to a variable. What are the possible final values of x and y now?

> There are three atomic operations, but I do not think we need to take into account them. This is also done in the example. Why?


Constraint: read must happen before write for each process. 

The following interleaving: 
- R1, W1, R2, W2 => x:= 5, y:= 15 
- R1, R2, W1, W2 => x:= 5, y:= 6 
- R1, R2, W2, W1 => x:= 5, y:= 6 
- R2, R1, W1, W2 => x:= 5, y:= 6 
- R2, R1, W2, W1 => x:= 5, y:= 6 
- R2, W2, R1, W2 => x:= 8, y:= 6

Final states: 
{ (x:= 5 & (y := 6 | y:= 15)) | (x:=8 & y:= 6) }


## Ext. 6 At most once

Given the program:

```
int x:= 1, y:= 1; 

co
    <x:=x+y> #S1
||
    y:=0;    #S2
||
    x:= x-y; #S3
oc
```

Which statement satisfies the at most once property?

Both S1 and S2 references two critical references with the assignment. 

S2 however satisfies the at most once property because it does not reference any critical references 


Final values?

Since we now that S2 satisfies the at most once property, we can consider it atomic!

S1, S2, R3, W3 are the things we need to consider. The constraints are that read must become before write 

- S1, S2, R3, W3 
- S1, R3, S2, W3
- S1, R3, W3, S2 
- S2, S1, R3, W3
- S2, R3, W3, S1 
- R3, W3, S1, S2
- R3, S1, W3, S2
- R3, S2, W3, S1

Final state: 
y := 0 & (0 <= x <= 2)


## Ext. 7 At most once

```
int x:= 0, y:=10; 

co
    while(x!=y) x:=x+1;
|| 
    while(x!=y) y:=y-1;
oc
```

Does all parts of this program satisfy the At most once property?

Yes. There is no critical reference, because no other process that reference other variables. 

Will the program terminate?

Yes, sometimes. It will terminate when they are both ordered in such a way that one of the process increment or decrement above or below the other variable such that they are never able to meet.
