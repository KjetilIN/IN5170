## Ex1. Parallelism and concurrency

Parallelism implies that execution run at the same time. 

Concurrent processes appear to be executed at the same time, but in reality is just an illusion provided by the OS. The two processes start at the same time and run and complete in overlapping time periods, but not necessary at the same time. 

Given that we have a mono-processor, can we use concurrency to speed up the program? 

**Yes!** Concurrency could even then speed up the process of executing programs. For example while another process is waiting (for I/O or requests), we can then execute another step in another task. 

Imagine having to download from multiple URL's. **Without concurrency, the CPU has to wait for the data to be downloaded for each URL before moving on.** By downloading all the data concurrently, the CPU will be better used and will overall complete the task faster. 


## Ex2. Pattern Finder

Given the following await code: 

```
string buffer;
bool done := false;

process Finder { 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        wait for buffer to be full or done to be true ;
        if ( done ) break ;
        line1 := buffer ;
        signal that buffer is empty ;
        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader { # r e a d new l i n e s
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line ;
        if (EOF) { done := true ; break ; }
        wait for buffer to be empty ;
        buffer := line2 ;
        signal that buffer is full ;
    }
}

```

### Part A: Add sync code for synchronizing access to buffer: 

Adding a lock to the critical sections. 
The suggested solution is to use a lock.
With await syntax, the solution is: 

```
string buffer;
bool done := false;
bool buffer_full := false; 

process Finder { 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        //wait for buffer to be full or done to be true 
        if ( done ) break ;

        while(!buffer_full){ skip }
        line1 := buffer; 
        buffer_full:= false;

        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader { 
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line ;
        if (EOF) { done := true ; break ; }

        // Appending data to the buffer again 
        while(buffer_full){ skip }
        buffer := line2;
        buffer_full := true; 
    }
}

```

### Part B: Extend the program to read two files 

To ensure that the algorithm is fair, we need to implement fairness into the processes. The best algorithm in this case, is the Ticket algorithm. 

> Notes: I think this is wrong

```
string buffer;
bool done := false;
bool buffer_full := false; 

int number := 1;
int next := 1;
int turn[1:n*2] := ([n*2] 0);

process Finder [i = 1 to n]{ 
    string line1;
    while (true) {
        //wait for buffer to be full or done to be true 
        if ( done ) break ;

        // take turn with fetch-add as atomic operation
        turn[i] = FA(number, a);

        while(turn[i] != next) {skip}; 
        while(!buffer_full){ skip }

        // CS
        line1 := buffer; 
        buffer_full:= false;
        next := next + 1

        look for pattern in line1 ;
        if (pattern is line1){
            write line1; 
        }
    }
}

process Reader [i = 1 to n]{ 
    string line2 ;
    while ( true ) {
        read next line of input into line2 or set EOF after last line ;
        if (EOF) { done := true ; break ; }

        // take turn with fetch-add as atomic operation
        turn[i] = FA(number, a);

        // Skip until turn 
        while(turn[i] != next) {skip}; 
        while(buffer_full){ skip }

        buffer := line2;
        buffer_full := true; 
        next := next + 1; 
    }
}

```
