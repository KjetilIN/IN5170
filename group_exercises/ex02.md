Enabledness:
- a statement is enabled in a state if the statement can in principle be executed next

Unconditional fair: 
- Scheduling strategy that guarantees that each unconditional atomic action will eventually be chosen

Weak fair scheduling: 
- unconditional fair  
- every conditional atomic action will eventually be chosen, assuming that the condition becomes true and remains true until the action is executed.

Strongly fair scheduling:
- unconditional fair 
- every conditional atomic action will be chosen if the condition is infinitely often enabled. 

## Exercise 1 

```text
co
    <await (x>=3) x:=x-3> #P1
||
    <await (x>=2) x:=x-2> #P2
||
    <await (x=1) x:=x+5> #P3
oc
```

For which initial values of x does the program terminate (under weakly fair scheduling)? What are the corresponding final values?

X is a positive integer:

- x <= 0: Lower than 0, then all is blocking. No termination 
- x = 1: will start P3, and P2, P1 can execute at any order. Terminates 
- x = 2: will enter P2, and then x = 0. Then the other two will not terminate. No termination
- x = 3: May terminate. If enter P1 then it will not terminate (x will then be set be 0). If enter P2 it will terminate.
- x = 4; May terminate. 
- x = 5: No termination. X will be 0 after P1 and P2, and therefor will not execute P3
- x = 6: Always terminates. P1 and P2 will happen at any order and P3 will determinate. 
- x >= 7: Never terminate because x will always be greater than 1, so P3 will not happen. 

## Exercise 2

```text
co
    <await (x>0) x:= x-1> #P1
||
    <await (x<0) x:= x+2> #P2
||
    <await (x=0) x:=x+5> #P3
oc
```

For which initial values of x does the program terminate (under weakly fair scheduling)? What are the corresponding final values?

- x <= -2: Never terminate. 
- x = -1: Always terminate. Will be -1
- x = 0: Always terminates. Will be 0
- x = 1: Always terminate. Will be 1
- x >= 2: Never terminate 


## Exercise 3


### Part 1

```text
int x := 10;
bool c:= true; 

co 
    <await (x=0)>; c:=false #P1
||
    while(c) <x:=x-1> #p2
oc
```

Do we have:

1. Termination under weak fairness 


2. Termination under strong fairness


### Part 2

Program is extended to: 

```text
int x := 10;
bool c:= true; 

co 
    <await (x=0)>; c:=false #P1
||
    while(c) <x:=x-1> #P2
||
    while(x) {if(x < 0) <x:=10>; } #P3
oc
```

1. Termination under weak fairness: 

No, we still have process two that will disable the action. 


2. Termination under strong fairness: 

Yes, x can be infinite often be set to 10, and this gives the program option to terminate. 


### Exercise 4

This is Dekker's algorithm

```text
bool enter1 := false; 
bool enter2 := true;
int turn := 1; 

process P1{
    while(true){
        enter1:=true
        while(enter2){
            if(turn = true){
                enter1 := false;
                while(turn = 2) skip;
                enter1 := true; 
            }
        }

        enter1 := false;
        turn := 2; 
    }
}


process P2{
    while(true){
        enter2 := true;
        while(enter1){
            if(turn = 1){
                enter2 := false; 
                while(turn = 1) skip;
                enter2 := true; 
            }
        }

        enter2:= true;
        turn := 1;
    }
}

```

Are the following properties met?: 

1. Mutual Exclusion:

This means only one process can access at the time.

TODO: Argu. Answer: Yes 


2. Absence of deadlock 

Avoid deadlocks. Deadlocks means that the program does not get anywhere

Loops gives the possibility for deadlocks. 

TODO: argu for the while-loops. You will see why. Answer: Yes, absence of deadlock

3. Absence of unnecessary delay 

TODO: argu. Define it. Ans: Yes, there is no unnecessary delays.

4. Eventual entry

Todo: argu. Yes both will. 

Every process will enter the critical section eventually.

How many times can P1, that wants to enter the critical section, be bypassed by P2 before the first gets in? 

TOOD: argu 


### Exercise 5


```text
```

Delay: guarantees that other process can do something
