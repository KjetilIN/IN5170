# Group exercise 3 - Semaphores and Monitors 

## 1. (Semaphores: Precedence graph)

A precedence graph is a directed, acyclic graph. Nodes represent tasks, and arcs indicate the order in which tasks are to be accomplished. In particular, a task can execute as soon as all its predecessors have been completed. Assume that the tasks are processes and that each process has the following outline.

- 5 nodes. 
- T1 first
- T2 and T3 can run concurrently
- T4 must be after T2
- T5 must be after T4 and T3

Using semaphores, show how to synchronize five processes. Minimize the use of semaphores and do not impose other contains.

Solution: 

The first constraint is that T1 has to finish before T2 and T3 start. We can do this by having a single  semaphore called t1_done. We signal to this **twice** after T1 is done. We make both T2, and T3 wait on the t1_done semaphore. T1 does signal twice, which allows both T2 and T3 to run concurrently. 

Next constraint is that T2 have to signal T4 to wait. By having a semaphore that signals when T2 is done, then we can use that semaphore to make T4 wait before execution.

The last constraint is that can only execute after all other processes have executed. We can achieve this by making it wait on two semaphores. One for T3 and T4, after waiting on both, we are guaranteed that it will execute last. 

In total there is 4 semaphores needed, all with initial value 0. Here is the solution: 

```text

sem t1_done;
sem t2_done;
sem t3_done;
sem t4_done;

process T1{
    // SIGNAL ENTRY (non in this case)
    body of task;

    // Give two permits 
    V(t1_done);
    V(t1_done);
}


process T2{
    P(t1_done);
    body of task;
    V(t2_done);
}

process T3{
    P(t1_done);
    body of task;
    V(t3_done);
}


process T4{
    // Wait until t2 is done
    P(t2_done);
    body of task;
    V(t4_done);
}


process T5{
    // Wait on both t2 and t3 is done 
    P(t3_done);
    P(t4_done);
    body of task;
    // SIGNAL SUCCESS
}
```

## 2. (Semaphores: Bear and honeybees)

Given are **n** honeybees and a hungry bear. They share a pot of honey. The pot is initially empty; its capacity is **H** portions of honey. The bear sleeps until the pot is full, then eats all the honey and goes back to sleep. Each bee repeatedly gathers one portion of honey and puts it in the pot; the bee who fills the pot awakens the bear. Represent the bear and honeybees as processes and develop code that simulates their actions. Use semaphores for synchronization.

Summary: 

- N bees
- 1 bear
- One honeypot to share
- H capacity in the pot. 
- Bear only eats when pot is full
- Each bee put 1 portion into the pot, and bee to fill the portion will awake the bear


Solution: 

We use a semaphore as a mutex to access the pot, we treat pot as CS. 
Then we use a semaphore to wake up the bear. Each bee first requires the semaphore to increment the count 

```text
// Max capacity H
int H;

// Semaphore for pot is full
sem pot_full;

// Semaphore that acts as a mutex to access the pot and the capacity 
sem pot_mutex = 1;

// Counter for pot capacity 
int pot_count = 0;

process bee[i = 0, i to N]{
    P(pot_mutex);

    // Only if the pot has capacity we do something with the pot 
    if(pot_count < H){
        // Add 
        add honey;
        pot_count += 1;

        // Check if bear need to access pot
        if (pot_count = H){
            // Signal pot is full;
            V(pot_full);
        }
    }

    // Release pot mutex
    V(pot_mutex)
}

process bear{
    // Wait for pot to be full
    P(pot_full);

    // Get mutex of the pot 
    P(pot_mutex);

    bear eat all honey;
    pot_count = 0;
    bear sleep;
    
    // Release mutex 
    V(pot_mutex)
}
```


100% correct solution: 
The correct way to solve this was with a split binary semaphore. It is a producer consumer problem. 
The correct way is to mutex the bees (which we already have). The trick is that we either signal another bee to collect, or we signal a bear to eat:

```text
// Semaphore for collecting or not
// THIS FORMS THE SPLIT SEMAPHORE
sem collect = 1; 
sem eat = 0;

// Counter for pot capacity 
int pot_count = 0;

process bee[i = 0, i to N]{
    while(true){
        P(collect)
        pot_count = pot_count + 1;

        // Signal bear or bee based on who is eating next
        if(pot_count = H){
            V(eat);
        }else{
            V(collect);
        }

    }
}

process bear{
    while(true){
        P(eat);

        // Eat:
        pot_count = 0;


        // Signal bee to eat 
        V(collect);
    }   
}

```

## 3. (Monitors: Signaling disciplines and SJN)

Consider the proposed solution to the shortest-job-next allocation problem:

```text
monitor Shortest_Job_Next{
    bool free := true;
    cond turn; 

    procedure request(int time){
        if (free = false){
            wait(turn, time);
        }
        
        free := false;
    }

    procedure release(){
        free := true;
        signal(turn);
    }

}
```


Note:
- wait() method for the procedure is implemented with a prioritized wait. The procedure with the least given time, will be woken up first.  

### Does this solution work correctly for the signal and continue discipline? 

Signal and Continue does not work. This is because it does not give direct access to the next task in the queue. This then does not do what we try to achieve, by having this shortest job first. This could allow a new process to skip the queue. 

This is all because we cannot guarantee that the next process to be executed is the next in turn, when we have the signaling principle. 


### Does it work correctly for signal and wait?

With signal-and-wait, control immediately transfers to the signaled process, ensuring that processes waiting for the resource are given a chance to proceed as soon as they are signaled. This discipline works correctly in the given solution because it prevents other processes from acquiring the resource before the signaled process does. 

## 4. (Monitor solution to reader/writer problem)

In this program assume **signal and continue (sc)** discipline.

```text
monitor RW_Controller{
    // Invariant: (nr = 0 | nw = 0) & nw <=1

    int nr := 0; // Number of readers 
    int nw := 0; // Number of writers

    cond oktoread; // Signaled when nw = 0
    cond oktowrite; // Signaled when nr = 0 and nw = 0    


    procedure request_read(){
        while(nw > 0) wait(oktoread);
        nr := nr + 1;
    }

    procedure release_read(){
        nr:= nr - 1;

        // Wake up one writer 
        if (nr = 0){
            signal(oktowrite);
        }
    }

    procedure request_write(){
        while(nr > 0 & nw > 0) wait(oktowrite);
        nw := nw + 1;
    }

    procedure release_write(){
        nw := nw - 1;
        signal(oktowrite);
        signal_all(oktoread);
    }    
}

```


#### A: Modification signal_all to signal

In the monitor, the primitive signal all is used in release write(). Modify the monitor
so that it uses signal instead but still awakes all readers waiting on oktoread.
 
Loop over the queue while the queue is not empty. Then signal a reader thread to start reading. This will work since we assume signal-and-continue, which will make the signaler continue to wake up all oktoread threads until the queue is empty. All reader threads will therefore we woken up. 

```text
procedure release_write(){
    nw := nw - 1;

    signal(oktowrite);

    // Looping until it is empty
    while(!empty(oktoread)) {
        signal(oktoread);
    }
}

```


#### B: Make writer take precedence  

In the given monitor, readers take precedence over writers. Modify the monitor such that
writers take precedence over readers.

Solution: 

The standard solution will make all readers have precedence over writer. To make writer have precedence, we must make readers wait, if there are any writers that are active, or if there is a **delayed** writer (a writer that are going to write later). This will solve the problem: 

```text
monitor RW_Controller{
    // Invariant: (nr = 0 | nw = 0) & nw <=1

    int nr := 0; // Number of readers 
    int nw := 0; // Number of writers
    int dw := 0; // Number of delayed writers 

    cond oktoread; // Signaled when nw = 0
    cond oktowrite; // Signaled when nr = 0 and nw = 0    


    procedure request_read(){
        // Reading have less priority, wait when there is a active writer or delayed reader
        while(nw + dw > 0) wait(oktoread);
        nr := nr + 1;
    }

    procedure release_read(){
        nr:= nr - 1;

        // Wake up one writer 
        if (nr = 0){
            signal(oktowrite);
        }
    }

    procedure request_write(){
        // Write only when there is neither active
        while(nr > 0 || nw > 0){
            // Add a delayed writer request
            dw := dw + 1;

            // Wait until signaled to write
            wait(oktowrite);

            // Delayed writer has now been signaled to write
            dw := dw - 1;
        }

        // Write 
        nw := nw + 1;
    }

    procedure release_write(){
        nw := nw - 1;
        
        // Wake up one writer 
        if(!empty(oktowrite)){
            signal(oktowrite);
        }else{
            signal_all(oktoread);
        }
    }    
}

```


#### C: Access resource in turns

Modify the monitor so that readers and writers are allowed to access the resource in turns if both readers and writers want to access the resource.

Solution:

To solve this, we do the same as B. But this time we assure that when there is a writer that wants to write, then the reader must wait. And opposite. To summarize: 
- Readers must give access to writers
- Writers must give access to readers 

In this case we allow all woken up readers to read before a writer starts to write. 

```text
monitor RW_Controller{
    // Invariant: (nr = 0 | nw = 0) & nw <=1

    int nr := 0; // Number of readers 
    int nw := 0; // Number of writers
    int dw, dr := 0 // Number of delayed readers and writers 
    int startup := 0 // Number of readers to be woken up

    cond oktoread; // Signaled when nw = 0
    cond oktowrite; // Signaled when nr = 0 and nw = 0    


    procedure request_read(){
        // Wait if there are delayed writers 
        if(nw + dw > 0){ 
            dr := dr + 1;
            wait(oktoread);
            dr := dr - 1;
            startup := startup -1;
        }

        nr := nr + 1;
    }

    procedure release_read(){
        nr:= nr - 1;

        // Wake up one writer, if there is no active reader and no reader to 
        if (nr = 0 && startup = 0){
            signal(oktowrite);
        }
    }

    procedure request_write(){
        // Wait until there is no, delayed readers, active readers and active writers
        while(nr + dr + nw + dw > 0) wait(oktowrite);
        nw := nw + 1;
    }

    procedure release_write(){
        nw := nw - 1;
        
        // Releasing writer should signal any waiting readers
        // In this case we wake them all up
        if (dr > 0){
            signal_all(oktoread);
            startup := dr; 
        }else{
            // If there are no delayed writer, then we can signal another writer to write
            signal(oktowrite);
        }
    }    
}

```

#### D: FCFS monitor 

Modify the monitor such that both readers and writers access the resource in a first-come-first-served (FCFS) manner. Allow more than one reader to access the resource as long as the FCFS-principle is satisfied. You may assume to have a (FIFO) queue q with the following operations:
- enqueue(q,X) returns q with the element X added at the end of the queue;
- dequeue(q) returns q with the first element removed;
- inspect(q) returns the first element of the queue without altering q;
- empty(q) returns true only when q is empty;
- an empty queue is declared by the statement queue q := empty.

Solution:

```text
monitor RW_Controller{
    // Invariant: (nr = 0 | nw = 0) & nw <=1

    int nr := 0; // Number of readers 
    int nw := 0; // Number of writers

    // Constants to represent a queue read or write request
    bool READER := false; 
    bool WRITER := true;

    // Empty queue
    queue q := empty;

    cond oktoread; // Signaled when nw = 0
    cond oktowrite; // Signaled when nr = 0 and nw = 0    


    procedure request_read(){
        // Active writer or there are a waiting process
        if (nw > 0 || q != empty){
            // Queue the read request
            q := enqueue(q, READER);

            // Wait until read is signaled
            wait(oktoread);

            // Dequeue and start reading
            q := dequeue(q);
        }
        
        nr := nr + 1;
    }

    procedure release_read(){
        nr:= nr - 1;

        if (nr = 0 && inspect(q) = WRITER){
            signal(oktowrite);
        }
    }

    procedure request_write(){
        // Check if we need to queue a writing process
        if(nr > || nw > 0 || q != empty){
            q := enqueue(q, WRITER);
            wait(oktowrite);
            q := dequeue(q);
        }

        nw := nw + 1;
    }

    procedure release_write(){
        nw := nw - 1;
        
        if(q != empty){
            if(inspect(q) = READER){
                signal(oktoread);
            }else{
                signal(oktowrite);
            }
        }
    }    
}

```



## Other Learnings:

- While loops instead of if-statements to ensure that the condition is rechecked after being 
  - Example:
    ```text
    procedure request_write(){
        while(nr > 0 & nw > 0) wait(oktowrite);
        nw := nw + 1;
    }
    ```
    Here the process waits when there is no readers and writers. If there is either, then the procedure is put in the queue by the `wait` method. When woken up it will be rechecked that the same invariant holds. This means that we **ensure that we can write by rechecking the condition**, and that is why while loops are used.
- When a `wait` is called in monitor, the procedure will be put in a queue, and will start executing again, when it is signaled and it at the head of the queue.
- Also remember the important thing about monitors. Only one can access at the time. Calling `wait` will make the procedure give access to other resources, until it is signaled.
- Task 4 is difficult, because you need to continue to hold the
