# Q3

Channel-view on a single read future: 
- Create a channel and send via an async message

In the exercise we want to read multiple times. 
Note: when we read the channel, we are removing the value from the channel. 

One way to solve would be to send the value all the time, so that you can the read all the time. This uses a lot of resources: 
- Busy wait
- Also does not terminate 

What we see is that Go does not work well for multiple reads on a channel. When we read a value, we expect the reader to take the value and therefore "not need it" on that channel
